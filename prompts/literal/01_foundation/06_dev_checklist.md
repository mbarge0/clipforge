**When to use:** After architecture is complete, before implementation begins.
**When not to use:** During architecture design or active coding.

Letâ€™s create a development checklist using the Checklist Loop Template.
Convert all PRD and architecture elements into concrete, testable tasks.
Group by module (auth, chat, AI, etc.) and output to `/docs/foundation/dev_checklist.md`.

**Checklist Loop Template reference:** `/prompts/system/foundation/06_dev_checklist_loop.md`

Foundation documents are located in /docs/foundation folder.
