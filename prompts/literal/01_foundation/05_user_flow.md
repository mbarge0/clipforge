**When to use**: When designing or validating the **sequence of user interactions** across a feature, app, or workflow.
**When not to use**: When focusing on technical architecture — use **“Architecture Loop”** instead.

Let’s define the user flow using the **User Flow Loop Template**.
Map each **primary user journey**, including entry points, decision paths, and outputs.
Ensure that every flow aligns with **PRD user stories** and that **edge cases, transitions, and states** are represented.
Confirm the **target platform(s)** before generating the flow.
When confirmed, write the result to `/docs/foundation/user_flow.md`.
**User Flow Loop Template reference**: `/prompts/system/foundation/05_user_flow_loop.md`
