**When to use**: When defining, updating, or validating the **core technology stack** for a project, module, or platform.
**When not to use**: When focusing on high-level architecture or implementation details — use **“Architecture”** or **“Refactor”** instead.

Let’s define the project’s technology stack using the **Tech Stack Loop Template**.
Identify all **frameworks, languages, SDKs, APIs, hosting platforms, and build tools** used across the system.
Describe how each technology maps to a **Supermodule or subsystem** and clarify **versioning, configuration, and dependencies**.
Highlight **trade-offs, alternatives considered**, and **compatibility notes**.
Before writing the Tech Stack document, confirm the intended scope (**core, backend, frontend, or full stack**).
When confirmed, write the result to `/docs/foundation/tech_stack.md`.
**Tech Stack Loop Template reference**: `/prompts/system/foundation/03_tech_stack_loop.md`

PRD is located inside `/docs/foundation` folder.
