## Reflection

### Phase Context
- Phase: 03 — Timeline & Playback
- Duration: Plan → Build → Debug → Optimize completed within scheduled window
- Objectives: Implement 2-track timeline, core clip interactions (add/trim/split/move/delete/undo/copy-paste), keyboard shortcuts, preview sync, and multi-track playback.
- Checkpoints: `phase-03-01-plan.md`, `phase-03-02-build.md`

### Achievements
- Timeline Core:
  - Two fixed tracks with time ruler, playhead, snap-to-grid (100ms), and drag-n-drop from Media Library.
  - Interactions: select, move (bidirectional), trim (edge handles), split at playhead (Cmd/Ctrl+B), delete, undo (≥10), copy/paste (Cmd/Ctrl+C/V).
- Playback:
  - HTML5 video preview synchronized to playhead; Space toggles play/pause.
  - Multi-track playback with track-priority rules (Track 1 preferred, fallback to Track 2), continuous switching as the playhead crosses boundaries.
  - requestAnimationFrame-based playhead and smooth scrubbing; optional requestVideoFrameCallback path.
- Performance & Stability:
  - Managed URL cache for media object URLs; eliminated premature revocation.
  - FPS and scrub-latency HUD for QA; sustained smooth playback under typical multi-track usage.
- Documentation:
  - Plan, Build (with UI Review + Debug), and Source of Truth updated.

### Challenges
- Playback stutter at boundaries and initial start.
- Dragging only moving right; cross-track movement unclear.
- Active-clip resolution across tracks; selection stability during playback.
- Undo occasionally skipping actions.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Stutter: playhead advanced by interval and seeks with coarse thresholds caused visible hops; simultaneous decoding risk.
- Drag behavior: delta computation was based on cursor rather than original clip start; no cross-track lane detection.
- Active-clip logic: track preference order inverted in earlier iterations; selection didn’t auto-update at boundaries.
- Undo misses: history push not consistently executed before state mutations.

### Process Evaluation
- Code quality: Clear separation of types (`timeline.ts`), store (`store/timeline.ts`), and UI components; small, readable reducers.
- Architecture alignment: Renderer-only media/preview, Electron security posture untouched; state via Zustand.
- Tooling: Prompt templates kept flow organized; iterative debug captured in build doc updates.
- Testing: Manual QA thorough; added HUD for quick perf checks; unit tests still a future pass.

### Phase Performance Score
- 92% — MVP goals achieved with smooth playback and robust interactions. Zoom controls deferred by design; automated tests remain to be added.

### Key Learnings
- Frame-synced updates (rVFC/RAF) reduce desync vs timer-driven loops.
- Centralized object URL lifecycle prevents subtle preview regressions.
- Snap-to-grid plus overlap resolution improves UX and correctness.

### Actionable Improvements
- Add unit tests for clip math (trim/split), reducers, and selection logic.
- Introduce Tailwind tokens to standardize focus/hover/spacing.
- Implement sequential playlist preview spanning multiple clips automatically (beyond current active-at-playhead model, if desired).

### Forward Outlook
- Next phase depends on Export and/or Recording Engine; ensure timeline state is consumable by export planner.
- Consider adding zoom and timeline minimap post-MVP.
- Evaluate adding project persistence (JSON) once core flows stabilize.

### Reflection Summary
- The Timeline & Playback supermodule reached a stable, performant MVP with multi-track, priority-based playback and fluid interactions. The system is ready to support Export and Recording with confidence.

## Handoff

### Current State
- Timeline & Playback implemented and stable in dev.
- Track-priority playback verified; smooth transitions across clips; bidirectional drag with snap; selection persists.

### Artifacts
- Plan: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-03-01-plan.md`
- Build: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-03-02-build.md`
- Reflect (this file): `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-03-03-reflect.md`
- Source of Truth: `/docs/operations/source_of_truth.md`

### Code Entry Points
- Types & utils: `renderer/src/lib/timeline.ts`
- URL cache: `renderer/src/lib/urlCache.ts`
- Store: `renderer/src/store/timeline.ts`
- UI: `renderer/src/components/Timeline.tsx`, `renderer/src/components/Preview.tsx`
- Integration: `renderer/src/App.tsx`

### Run & Build
- Dev: `npm run dev` (Electron + Vite)
- Package: `npm run package` (electron-forge)
- Makers configured via electron-forge; ensure FFmpeg binaries unpacked if adding export/record.

### Environment & Dependencies
- No special env vars required for this phase.
- Node/Electron versions pinned by repo; see `package.json`.

### Testing & Verification
- Manual QA flows:
  - Import → add to timeline (both tracks) → trim/split/move → play/pause (Space) → verify smooth transitions.
  - Copy/paste → undo → delete → verify state and UI reflect correctly.
  - Scrub via ruler drag → confirm responsive preview and latency HUD.
- Lint/Typecheck: clean for modified files in this phase.

### Deployment Readiness
- Dev build stable; packaged app test recommended before release.
- No backend; local filesystem only.

### Next Phase Handoff Notes
- Export Pipeline: consume timeline to build concat/encode plan; maintain track order semantics.
- Recording Engine: ensure new recordings register in Media Library and can be auto-placed on timeline.
- Performance: keep rAF/rVFC loop and object URL cache patterns.

### Resources for Continuity
- Branch: `timeline` (or current working branch)
- Docs: PRD, Architecture, Dev Checklist under `/docs/foundation`
- Logs: See `phase-03-02-build.md` Debug sections for change history.
