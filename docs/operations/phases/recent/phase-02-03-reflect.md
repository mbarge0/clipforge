## Reflection

### Phase Context
- Phase: 02 — Media Library & Import
- Duration: Planning + Build completed within targeted window
- Objectives: Implement import via drag-drop/picker with validation, metadata, thumbnails; align with PRD and Dev Checklist §3.2
- References: `phase-02-01-plan.md`, `phase-02-02-build.md`, PRD §Media Management

### Achievements
- Delivered Media Library UI with accessible drag-and-drop zone and file picker.
- Implemented validation (MP4/MOV/WebM; ≤ 500MB) with clear rejection messages.
- Extracted duration and resolution via HTMLVideoElement; generated thumbnails via canvas (≤ 320px width).
- Preserved security posture: no new IPC; renderer uses DOM APIs only; preload bridge intact.
- Documentation updated: consolidated Build report and Source of Truth entries.

### Challenges
- Handling metadata extraction timing: seeking to mid-frame can time out on some files.
- Balancing thumbnail quality vs memory: full-resolution canvas spikes memory on large sources.
- Styling system not yet integrated (Tailwind/tokens planned), requiring careful inline styles for accessibility and contrast.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Seek timing: Some codecs/files delay `seeked`; added short timeout and fallback to current frame.
- Memory pressure: Large frames drive canvas memory; added scale cap (≤320px) and ensured object URLs are revoked.
- UI tokens absence: MVP uses inline styles; planned migration to tokenized Tailwind will standardize visuals and states.

### Process Evaluation
- Code quality: Clear utilities in `renderer/src/lib/media.ts` centralize formats/limits; component code is readable.
- Architecture alignment: Strict adherence to security constraints (contextIsolation, no Node in renderer).
- Testing: Manual QA verified happy paths and invalid cases; unit tests for validators deferred to later test pass.
- Documentation: Plan/Build/Reflect created; Source of Truth updated with accurate stack and file paths.

### Phase Performance Score
- 93% — All MVP objectives achieved with good stability; automated tests and styling tokens deferred to future phases.

### Key Learnings
- Renderer DOM APIs are sufficient for MVP metadata/thumbnail needs; ffprobe can be deferred.
- Early validation and toasts improve UX and reduce debugging churn.
- Object URL lifecycle management is essential to avoid leaks during multiple imports.

### Actionable Improvements
- Introduce Tailwind + tokens to replace inline styles and standardize focus/hover.
- Add unit tests for validators and metadata helpers (Vitest) in the next QA pass.
- Consider optional IPC path for OS-level errors and future file operations.

### Forward Outlook
- Next Supermodule: Timeline & Playback — consume Media Library items for drag-to-timeline, preview sync.
- Dependencies: Maintain import metadata shape; plan store types for `Clip` and library index.
- Opportunity: Virtualize media list if it grows; not required now.

### Reflection Summary
- Media Library MVP is working, secure, and aligned with PRD. The approach favors simplicity and reliability, setting a stable base for Timeline work.

## Handoff (Context Summary)

### Phase Summary
- Phase Name: Supermodule 2 — Media Library & Import
- Date Completed: 2025-10-27
- Duration: Plan + Build + Reflect window
- Phase Outcome: Import via drag-drop/picker with validation, metadata, and thumbnails delivered; docs updated.
- Stability Rating: High

### Core Deliverables
- Media Library UI and logic
  - `renderer/src/App.tsx`
  - `renderer/src/lib/media.ts`
- Documentation
  - `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-02-01-plan.md`
  - `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-02-02-build.md`
  - `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-02-03-reflect.md` (this file)
  - `/docs/operations/source_of_truth.md`

### Testing Status
- Manual QA: Valid MP4/MOV/WebM imports appear with thumbnails and metadata; invalid/oversize files show error toasts.
- Performance: Multiple sequential imports (≥5) without crash; thumbnail generation returns within ~0.5–1.5s per clip (size/codec dependent).
- Automated tests: Deferred (planned for validators and helpers in next QA pass).

### Risks and Limitations
- Styling tokens not applied yet; inline styles used for MVP.
- No ffprobe-level validation; extension-based validation only.
- No persistent project storage yet; paths/metadata live only in renderer state.

### Next Objectives
- Phase 03 — Timeline & Playback
  - Define entities (Clip, Track, TimelineState) and types
  - Render 2-track timeline and allow drag from Media Library
  - Implement trim/split basics and preview sync scaffolding
- Dependencies: Media Library items should expose path, durationMs, width, height, and thumbnail; plan store accordingly.

### Summary Statement
- The Media Library & Import phase is complete and stable, with reliable import, validation, metadata, and thumbnails. Documentation is current, and the system is ready to proceed to Timeline & Playback with a clear set of next steps and minimal risk.
