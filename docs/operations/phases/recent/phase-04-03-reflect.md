## Reflection

### Phase Context
- Scope: Implement end-to-end Export Pipeline (planner → ffmpeg → progress/cancel → UI), path resolution for media, and a passing E2E test.
- References: Plan (`phase-04-01-plan.md`), Build (`phase-04-02-build.md`), PRD §2.5, Architecture §Export Flow.

### What We Built
- Export Pipeline (Main):
  - IPC: `export:start`, `export:progress`, `export:complete`, `export:cancel`, `export:chooseDestination`.
  - ffmpeg flow: per-segment encode with trim/scale, followed by concat demuxer to final MP4; `-y` overwrite and absolute output path.
  - Progress: continuous updates using `timemark` → total-duration %; throttled to ~5/sec.
  - Cancel: terminates current ffmpeg process; cleans temp files.
- Renderer:
  - Export Dialog: resolution select (720p/1080p/Source), destination choose, progress bar, cancel, toasts.
  - Export Planner: builds segments honoring Track 1 priority; resolves file paths from `sourcePath` → media index → `file.path`.
- Media Path Resolution:
  - Main IPC: `media:getPathForFileName` resolves absolute paths via Downloads/Movies/Documents/Desktop/cwd.
  - Import Flow: uses `(file as any).path`, falls back to IPC; `__MEDIA_DEBUG__` shows real paths.
  - Timeline: `onDrop` writes `sourcePath` into `TimelineClip` (Finder drops supported).
- E2E Test (Playwright):
  - Launch Electron → import sample → drag to timeline → export 1s segment → assert output exists (green).

### Challenges & Resolutions
- Missing path on imported media (and timeline clips):
  - Cause: no main handler for resolving paths; some drag sources lacked `(file as any).path`.
  - Fix: add `media:getPathForFileName` (search common dirs), capture `sourcePath` on clip creation; planner prefers `sourcePath`.
- Export progress stuck at 0%:
  - Cause: main returned `jobId` at end; renderer filtered out early events by jobId; no continuous updates.
  - Fix: return `jobId` immediately and run export async; compute % via `timemark`; throttle progress events.
- Output file missing with “success”:
  - Cause: success sent without verifying output existed or using absolute path.
  - Fix: resolve `destinationPath`, add `-y`, check `fs.existsSync` before success; log cwd and output path.

### Key Learnings
- Always attach a stable filesystem path to media at import time; avoid relying on ambient `File.path`.
- Progress UX depends on immediate job acknowledgment; streaming progress should be independent of the return path.
- ffmpeg concat is reliable when inputs are normalized first; logging absolute paths avoids confusion.

### What Went Well
- Clean IPC surface and preload bridge remained minimal and typed.
- Planner logic and path fallbacks reduced export failures significantly.
- Playwright test provided fast end-to-end validation.

### Improvements for Next Iteration
- Add codec/size uniformity detection to prefer stream-copy when possible.
- Factor export planner to a shared util with unit tests (boundary math, priority selection).
- Provide estimated time remaining using segment durations.

### Recommendations & Next Steps
- Add unit tests for planner and segment math; add a second E2E for cancel path.
- Wire `export:chooseDestination` into the test harness behind a flag for full UI-path coverage.
- Package verification: ensure `asarUnpack` covers ffmpeg binaries in distribution.

## Handoff

### Current State
- Export end-to-end functional in dev; progress updates live; cancel works; output verified.
- Import flow populates `MediaItemMeta.path`; timeline clips carry `sourcePath`.

### Artifacts
- Plan: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-04-01-plan.md`
- Build: `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-04-02-build.md`
- Reflect (this file): `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-04-03-reflect.md`
- Source of Truth updated with IPC & modules: `/docs/operations/source_of_truth.md`
- E2E Test: `/tests/export-flow.spec.ts`

### Code Entry Points
- Main process: `main/main.js` (export IPC + ffmpeg runner + path resolver)
- Preload: `main/preload.ts` (exposes invoke + export APIs)
- Renderer: `renderer/src/App.tsx` (Export UI + planner), `renderer/src/components/Timeline.tsx` (drops), `renderer/src/store/timeline.ts`

### How to Run
- Dev: `npm run dev` (Vite + Electron; ensure `VITE_DEV=1`)
- Playwright E2E: `npx playwright test -g "Export flow E2E" --reporter=line`

### Environment & Dependencies
- ffmpeg: `ffmpeg-static` + `fluent-ffmpeg` used at runtime.
- OS: macOS primary; path resolver checks `Downloads/Movies/Documents/Desktop/cwd`.
- No special env vars required for export.

### Testing & Verification
- E2E export test passes; verifies file existence post-export.
- Manual QA: import → drag to timeline → export with progress; cancel mid-run.

### Deployment Readiness
- In dev, export runs successfully; for packaging, verify ffmpeg binaries are accessible (asar unpack) and absolute paths remain valid.
- Recommend a packaging smoke test on macOS and Windows.

### Handoff Notes (Next Phase)
- Recording Engine can reuse path resolution and export runner patterns.
- Consider adding `ffprobe-static` for richer metadata where needed.

### Resources for Continuity
- Branch: current working branch (`timeline` or main working branch)
- Docs: PRD, Architecture, Dev Checklist under `/docs/foundation`
- Logs: main console will show `[export <jobId>]` lines with absolute paths and progress.
