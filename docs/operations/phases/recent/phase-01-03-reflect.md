## Reflection

### Phase Context
- Duration: Initial bootstrapping window
- Objectives: Secure Electron foundation, preload bridge, IPC baseline, dev/prod launch paths
- Checkpoints: Build report (`phase-01-02-build.md`) and Plan (`phase-01-01-plan.md`)

### Achievements
- Secured `BrowserWindow` (`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`) and wired `preload`.
- Implemented minimal IPC (`app:ping`) with typed bridge in `preload.ts` and renderer verification.
- Improved dev stability with GPU-disable switches to prevent macOS crash loop.
- Lint checks clean on edited renderer files; foundational config utilities (`ENV`, `logger`) available.

### Challenges
- Electron GPU sandbox instability in dev on macOS; caused intermittent launch crashes pre-patch.
- Ensuring preload typing while keeping API surface minimal.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Crash loop traced to GPU process/sandbox interactions in dev environment. Disabling GPU and sandbox resolved instability for development.
- Type exposure needed explicit `declare global` to satisfy TS while avoiding renderer Node access.

### Process Evaluation
- Code quality aligned with `architecture.md` and security constraints.
- Workflow effective: small, testable steps; lints enforced; manual smoke verified.
- Documentation kept in-phase (Plan, Build, Reflect). Regression manifest prepared for future modules.

### Phase Performance Score
- 92% — All core foundation goals met; packaging verification deferred to cross-module phase.

### Key Learnings
- Secure defaults first (isolation + preload) simplifies later module work.
- Add a trivial IPC health check early to accelerate smoke validation and debugging.
- Dev-only stability flags can be decisive on macOS; document them and avoid in production when possible.

### Actionable Improvements
- Add quick Launch Time check script to validate <5s target consistently.
- Introduce Zod validators for future IPC payloads as surfaces expand.
- Establish a minimal UI shell scaffold (toolbar/sidebar/timeline containers) ahead of Media Library.

### Forward Outlook
- Next phase: Supermodule 2 — Media Library & Import planning/build.
- Dependencies: Foundation IPC remains stable; ensure drag/drop and file picker respect security.
- Opportunities: Begin UI tokens integration and base component primitives.

### Reflection Summary
- Foundation is stable, secure, and verified with a simple IPC roundtrip. The dev environment is resilient after GPU/sandbox tweaks. We are ready to layer Media Library features with confidence.

## Handoff (Context Summary)

### Phase Summary
- Phase Name: Supermodule 1 — Foundation & Setup
- Date Completed: 2025-10-27
- Duration: Initial setup window
- Phase Outcome: Secure Electron foundation with preload bridge and working IPC; dev launch reliable.
- Stability Rating: High (dev); packaging readiness to be verified in Packaging phase.

### Core Deliverables
- Secure Electron config and preload bridge
  - `main/main.js`
  - `main/preload.ts`
- Renderer verification UI
  - `renderer/src/App.tsx` (IPC health indicator)
- Planning and build docs
  - `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-01-plan.md`
  - `/docs/operations/phases/recent/phase-01-02-build.md`
- Regression baseline
  - `/docs/operations/regression_manifest.md`
- Utilities
  - `config/environment.ts`, `config/logger.ts`, `config/index.ts`

### Testing Status
- Linting: Pass on edited renderer files.
- Manual Smoke: App loads; `IPC health: pong:hello` visible; Node APIs not exposed to renderer.
- Performance: Launch time target <5s — to be validated on reference machine.

### Risks and Limitations
- Packaging specifics (asarUnpack for ffmpeg-static) not validated in this phase.
- Dev-only GPU/sandbox flags should not ship to production — review during packaging.

### Next Objectives
- Plan and implement Supermodule 2 — Media Library & Import.
- Add basic UI shell containers following Design spec (toolbar/sidebar/timeline layout).
- Introduce IPC validators (Zod) as surfaces expand.

### Summary Statement
- The foundation phase delivers a secure, working Electron scaffold with a typed preload bridge and verified IPC. Documentation and regression references are in place, positioning the team to focus on Media Library next with minimal risk.
