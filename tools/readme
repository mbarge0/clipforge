# ðŸ§° Foundry Core Tools

This directory contains shared utilities that every Foundry template inherits.

Each tool should be self-contained, environment-agnostic, and versioned.

Example future tools:
- `foundry-showcase`
- `foundry-motion`
- `evolve-core`
- `visual-verification-core`

Tools are copied into every project automatically as declared in template.json.
